This report analyses performance measurements from the [browsertime](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime) test harness across the Firefox TV vehicle powered by different rendering engines.

This report was commissioned to try to replicate similar measurements performed using a different test harness and methodology, the [nimbledroid test suite](https://github.com/npark-mozilla/focus-nimbledroid/blob/master/fftv-tests/app/src/androidTest/java/com/nimbledroid/blackboxtest/EspressoTests.java).  As data was collected, the focus of the project shifted away from validating the nimbledroid test suite, and in fact the tested site corpus is almost entirely disjoint from the site corpus tested by the nimbledroid test suite.  Prior to shifting the corpus, however, the browsertime measurements were consonant with the nimbledroid measurements.

## Conclusions

### browsertime reports that GeckoView is slower than WebView 

```{r gv_over_wv, include=FALSE}
xx <- complete %>%
  group_by(engine, run, device, site, turbo) %>%
  filter(engine == 'GeckoView') %>%
  group_by(run, device, site, turbo) %>%
  summarise(pageLoadTime_mean=mean(pageLoadTime), pageLoadTime_rsd=sd(pageLoadTime)/mean(pageLoadTime)*100)

yy <- complete %>%
  group_by(engine, run, device, site, turbo) %>%
  filter(engine == 'WebView') %>%
  group_by(run, device, site, turbo) %>%
  summarise(pageLoadTime_mean=mean(pageLoadTime), pageLoadTime_rsd=sd(pageLoadTime)/mean(pageLoadTime)*100)

gv_over_wv <- inner_join(xx, yy, by=c("run", "device", "site", "turbo"))
gv_over_wv$speed_pct <- xx$pageLoadTime_mean/yy$pageLoadTime_mean
gv_over_wv$noise_pct <- xx$pageLoadTime_rsd/yy$pageLoadTime_rsd

gv_over_wv <- gv_over_wv %>% ungroup() %>% select(-starts_with('pageLoadTime'))
```

When running with **Turbo Mode disabled, GeckoView is perhaps 10% slower than WebView on the more powerful FireTV Stick 4k and Fire TV Pendant and perhaps 50% slower than WebView on the underpowered FireTV Cube.**  It seems that GeckoView is also much more variable than WebView -- perhaps as much as 200% more.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
turbo_off <- gv_over_wv %>% filter(turbo == 'false') %>% group_by(run, device) %>% summarise(`speed penalty`=mean(speed_pct), `noise penalty`=mean(noise_pct))
datatable(turbo_off, options=list(dom='t'), caption=('GeckoView pageload penalties with Turbo Mode disabled (lower is better)' %>% glue())) %>% formatPercentage(c(3, 4))
```

The performance gap does decrease with **Turbo Mode enabled: GeckoView is perhaps level with WebView on the FireTV Stick 4k and Fire TV Pendant and perhaps 40% slower than WebView on the FireTV Cube**.  However, GeckoView becomes significantly more variable than WebView.  This is very surprising because the set of processed resources should be smaller than with Turbo Mode disabled, which one expects to translate to less variability.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
turbo_on <- gv_over_wv %>% filter(turbo == 'true') %>% group_by(run, device) %>% summarise(`speed penalty`=mean(speed_pct), `noise penalty`=mean(noise_pct))
datatable(turbo_on, options=list(dom='t'), caption=('GeckoView pageload penalties with Turbo Mode enabled (lower is better)' %>% glue())) %>% formatPercentage(c(3, 4))
```

### browsertime reports that Turbo Mode improves performance at the expense of variability

```{r turbo, include=FALSE}
xx <- complete %>%
  group_by(turbo, run, device, site, engine) %>%
  filter(turbo == 'true') %>%
  group_by(run, device, site, engine) %>%
  summarise(pageLoadTime_mean=mean(pageLoadTime), pageLoadTime_rsd=sd(pageLoadTime)/mean(pageLoadTime)*100)

yy <- complete %>%
  group_by(turbo, run, device, site, engine) %>%
  filter(turbo == 'false') %>%
  group_by(run, device, site, engine) %>%
  summarise(pageLoadTime_mean=mean(pageLoadTime), pageLoadTime_rsd=sd(pageLoadTime)/mean(pageLoadTime)*100)

turbo_improvement <- inner_join(xx, yy, by=c("run", "device", "site", "engine"))
turbo_improvement$speed_pct <- xx$pageLoadTime_mean/yy$pageLoadTime_mean
turbo_improvement$noise_pct <- xx$pageLoadTime_rsd/yy$pageLoadTime_rsd

turbo_improvement <- turbo_improvement %>% ungroup() %>% select(-starts_with('pageLoadTime'))
```

With GeckoView: enabling turbo mode produces a performance increase, more significant on the underpowered FireTV Cube, and a significant noise increase.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gv.noise_improvement <- turbo_improvement %>% filter(engine == 'GeckoView') %>% group_by(run, device) %>% summarise(`speed improvement`=mean(speed_pct), `noise penalty`=mean(noise_pct))
datatable(gv.noise_improvement, options=list(dom='t'), caption=('GeckoView speed improvements and noise penalities with turbo mode enabled (lower is better)' %>% glue())) %>% formatPercentage(c(3, 4))
```

We see the same general behaviour with WebView: a performance increase on the underpowered FireTV Cube and a noise increase.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
webview_noise_improvement <- turbo_improvement %>% filter(engine == 'WebView') %>% group_by(run, device) %>% summarise(`speed change`=mean(speed_pct), `noise penalty`=mean(noise_pct))
datatable(webview_noise_improvement, options=list(dom='t'), caption=('WebView speed improvements and noise penalities with turbo mode enabled (lower is better)' %>% glue())) %>% formatPercentage(c(3, 4))
```

## Recommendations for Future Work

1.  The value of the `load` event, as measured by the `loadEventStart` timestamp captured by `pageLoadTime`, is questionable.  The next step is to capture similar numbers for various visual metrics that the Performance Team will provide more valuable measurements.

2.  GeckoView fires the `load` event generally after the system WebView does.  This effect is larger on the FireTV Cube, which we consider to be less powerful than the FireTV Pendant and the Fire TV Stick 4k, which suggests that Gecko has significant room to improve on low-end devices.

3.  The impact of Turbo Mode is surprising: it is counter-intuitive that reducing the total set of resources to process increases variability.  More investigation into how the Content Blocking system is working in Firefox TV and in GeckoView itself is needed.  It may also be the case that more valuable visual metrics improve while the Web Navigation Performance API metrics are stable.

4.  Quantifying the differences in the content served to GeckoView and WebView for the corpus under test could let us be more confident that measured differences are truly delivered by the underlying engines.

## Per-device, per-site engine comparisons

The following graphs give some insight into how GeckoView and WebView compare on the sites in the test corpus.

### Turbo Mode enabled

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=40}
xx <- complete %>% filter(complete$turbo == 'true') %>% group_by(device, run, site) %>% summarize(m=mean(pageLoadTime)) %>% ungroup() %>% arrange(m) %>% inner_join(complete, by=c('device', 'run', 'site'))
xx$site <- sub('https://', '', xx$site)
xx$site <- sub('http://', '', xx$site)
xx$site <- xx$site %>% str_trunc(30) %>% str_pad(30, 'right')

p <- ggplot(xx, aes(x=reorder(site, m), y=pageLoadTime))
p <- p + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=engine))
p <- p + facet_wrap(vars(device, run), ncol=1, scales='free', labeller=labeller(.multi_line=FALSE)) + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=-67.5, hjust=0, vjust=0)) + xlab('site')
p <- p + theme(legend.justification = c(0, 1), legend.position = c(0.04, 0.995))
p
```

### Turbo Mode disabled

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=40}
xx <- complete %>% filter(complete$turbo == 'false') %>% group_by(device, run, site) %>% summarize(m=mean(pageLoadTime)) %>% ungroup() %>% arrange(m) %>% inner_join(complete, by=c('device', 'run', 'site'))
xx$site <- sub('https://', '', xx$site)
xx$site <- sub('http://', '', xx$site)
xx$site <- xx$site %>% str_trunc(30) %>% str_pad(30, 'right')

p <- ggplot(xx, aes(x=reorder(site, m), y=pageLoadTime))
p <- p + geom_boxplot(aes(fill=engine))
p <- p + facet_wrap(vars(device, run), ncol=1, scales='free', labeller=labeller(.multi_line=FALSE)) + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=-67.5, hjust=0, vjust=0)) + xlab('site')
p <- p + theme(legend.justification = c(0, 1), legend.position = c(0.04, 0.995))
p
```

## Methodology

### Vehicles tested

The data were collected from the following vehicle configurations:

| vehicle | engine | turbo mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firefox for Fire TV | GeckoView | enabled |
| Firefox for Fire TV | GeckoView | disabled |
| Firefox for Fire TV | WebView | enabled |
| Firefox for Fire TV | WebView | disabled |

All vehicle configurations **shared a single User Agent string**.  See [this issue](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-tv/issues/1879).

### Sites tested

22 of the 25 sites in the [product mobile
corpus](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wqGfLaEKVDjfA-y4gZfcFRtjU3G0HzOxlcFTMlJGEJw/edit?ts=5bdb67e1#gid=596602279)
were tested.  The sites not tested were:

| site | reason |
| --- | --- |
| https://m.facebook.com/Cristiano | requires a login |
| https://hubs.mozilla.com/spES8RP/treasured-spirited-huddle | Web Sockets break record and replay proxy |
| https://www.allrecipes.com | fails to render in WebView due to invalid protocol error |

Some sites witnessed transient network errors: in these cases the
number of recorded measurements is fewer than expected.  In any
individual run, no site was measured fewer than 4 times on the Fire TV
Pendant and Cube, or fewer than 8 times on the Fire TV Stick 4k.

The entire corpus was tested end-to-end twice in succession on the
Fire TV Pendant and Cube, and end-to-end once on the Fire TV Stick.

### Single site test

For each site, the four vehicle configurations were tested as follows:

1. An initial recording of the live site was captured.  The record and
replay proxy was started in recording mode, and browsertime with
`--iterations 1` launched the vehicle and (cold-)loaded the site under test.
The replay proxy was stopped and an archive of the network activity
captured.

2. The record and replay proxy was started in replay mode, backed by
the archive of captured network activity.  browsertime, with
`--iterations 5` (respectively, `--iterations 9`) on the Fire TV
Pendant and Cube (respectively, Fire TV Stick 4k) launched the vehicle
and cold-loaded the site under test the specified number of times.
Between each cold-load the vehicle was force-stopped and its on-device
package-data cleared.

3. For each cold-load, browsertime reports a wide range of timings,
mostly from the [Performance Navigation Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming).

### Processed data

The data from the three test runs above can be found in the following
[CSV file](data/firetv.csv).  The columns of the CSV are as follows:

| column | description |
| --- | --- |
`device` | the target device, one of "Fire TV Stick 4k", "Fire TV Cube", or "Fire TV Pendant" |
| `run` | the test run number |
| `site` | the URL of the page being loaded |
| `engine` | the tested engine, either "GeckoView" or "WebView" |
| `turbo` | whether Turbo Mode was enabled, either "true" (meaning Turbo View was enabled) or "false" (meaning Turbo View was disabled) |
| `proxy` | the proxy state, either "record" (meaning the pageload was from the live network and the proxy was recording) or "replay" (meaning the pageload was from the replaying proxy and not from the live network) |
| `timestamp` | the local timestamp when the pageload was initiated |
| `pageLoadTime` | the [`loadEventStart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming/loadEventStart) timestamp reported by the engine under test, as captured [by this JavaScript code](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/blob/master/browserscripts/timings/pageTimings.js) |

## Inter-vehicle reliability

### Test harness

The data were collected using an ad-hoc Python harness driving the
[browsertime]() testing suite.  browsertime drives the underlying
vehicles using Web Driver automation; for WebView this means
`chromedriver` driving the engine via the Chrome Debug Protocol and
for GeckoView this means `geckodriver` driving the engine over the
Marionette protocol.

The version of browsertime used was lightly modified to support
Android-specific WebView engine configuration and to support the
GeckoView engine.  None of these modifications are believed to impact
engine performance.

The version of `geckodriver` was heavily modified to support the
GeckoView engine over the `adb` TCP/IP protocol.  These modifications
principally concern launching the target vehicle and connecting to the
underlying protocol handler; any impact on engine performance has to
do with servicing the underlying protocol and ambient engine
configuration (for example, custom profiles in GeckoView).

### Network weather

Both mitmproxy and Web Page Replay Go were used to minimize the impact
of network weather.  Because older versions of `adb` do not allow to
reverse port-forward over TCP/IP [link], the test host and the target
device were always on the same network.  Because Web Page Replay Go is
not a true HTTP proxy [link] but instead requires transparent
port-mapping [link] and because Gecko does not support such
port-mapping [link], mitmproxy was used to perform the port-mapping
[link to script].  Record and replay were provided by wpr-go, although
it is likely that mitmproxy could provide this function.

Using a proxy and a custom CA certificate for both WebView and
GeckoView sacrifices real-world characteristics for cross-engine
consistency.  GeckoView requires a true HTTP proxy for this type of
record and replay, and such a proxy requires either a custom CA
certificate or for the engine to allow insecure connections.
Allowing insecure connections is decidely _not_ real-world, hence we
took the lesser of two evils.

### Record and replay differences

The turbo mode option should change the network activity captured by
the record and replay proxy.  However, it is also possible that the
two engines witness different network activity -- for example, by User
Agent sniffing sites.  This means that each individual site and
vehicle configuration should have stable network activity, but between
vehicle configuraitons there could be network activity differences.

### Live site differences

Some of the sites serve dynamic content and/or advertisements.  This
means that between the first and second whole-corpus iteration, the
underlying network archives may have changed significantly.

### Gecko profile conditioning

It is well known that the Gecko profile significantly impacts the
performance of the Gecko engine: preferences, certificate databases,
and the network cache itself can have major impacts on measurements.

To minimize volatility, for each GeckoView-based vehicle
configuration, i.e., for both turbo enabled and turbo disabled, a
Gecko profile was conditioned as follows.  First, a profile template
with `cert9.db` and `key4.db` containing the custom CA certificate
used by the record and replay proxy was produced.  Second, this
template was copied to the target device, and the vehicle was started
from a cleared state with this profile.  The single page
`http://example.com` was visited and then the vehicle was left idle
for 2 minutes.  The vehicle was then force-stopped and the conditioned
profile retrieved from the device.

This conditioned profile was then copied to the device at the
beginning of every test run: that is, every cold pageload started with
exactly the same Gecko profile.
